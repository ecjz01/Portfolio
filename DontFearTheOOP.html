            Predators are based on the idea of fish. They are identical, except that they have some additional

            sharp teeth, a certain species of fish, some level of salt in their veins, and a certain amount of fish
            eaten. Your
            standard predator will look mean, start the day out without any salt in their veins, and not yet eaten any
            fish.
            Whenever the predator gets hungry, the amount of fish eaten will go up by one. If someone asks a predator
            how much
            fish they have eaten, the predator will always respond with the amount of fish eaten. If the predator is not
            having
