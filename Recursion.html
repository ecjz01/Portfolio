        Recursion is a way to solve problems, like an iterative solution. The criteria for a recursive solution include
        having a way to reduce the problem into smaller and repetitive elements, being able to find and reach the end of
        a solution, and creating a larger result from the smaller repetitive elements. The end of a solution is
        generally referred to as the base case. This is crucial to the solution, because without it the recursive
        solution will not be able to end. The other main types of recursion other than regular recursion are tail
        recursion and mutual recursion. Tail recursion, in which your calculations are performed first, so that when you
        make the recursive call it is sent to the next step in the recursion process. The other type of recursion is
        mutual recursion, which is the opposite of tail recursion, meaning that the calculations are performed after the
        recursion.

        There are many examples of recursion in the real world.
        One everyday example of recursion is when a person on a crowded public transit bus is trying to get off. When
        the person is trying to get off they have to ask the person in front of them to move, which causes them to ask
        the next person and so on. If the bus is too full those people will then have to get off the bus to let the
        person off and then come back on.

        You may wonder why you should use recursion in your solutions. There are two main reasons on why you should use
        recursion. The first being it is easier to understand a recursive method than a non-recursive method, because
        they are shorter and clearer. The second being the program will directly reflect the abstract solution strategy.

    <p><font size="+2" style="margin-left: 100px">
        However recursion isn't always great. There are two main problems associated with recursion. The first being
        that everything that is performed when the method is called: allocating, releasing and copying values into the
        local memory contribute to the overall time the method takes to complete. The second being every time the method
        is called, it may be necessary to allocate more space for the parameters and local variables of the method. This
        is so that the program knows where to go back to when the method has finished. So the amount of space needed may
        need to be similar to the amount of times the method will be called.

        If you're looking for an alternate solution due to those two problems, an option you could use instead is an
        iterative solution. An iterative solution means that instead of repeating a method to reduce the problem into
        smaller sections until a condition is met, you instead set a condition on a loop and then run the loop until the
        condition is met.
