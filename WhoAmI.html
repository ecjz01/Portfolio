    <h1><font size="+3"><b>Who Am I?</b></font></h1>
    <body><font size="+1">
        <p>From the Keirsey personality quiz I found out that I am of the category Guardian (45% of the population) and
            from the Humanmetrics Jung Typology Test I am an ISTJ (Introvert 31%, Sensing 16%, Thinking 66%, and Judging
            19%). This means that I am of the group Inspectors within the Guardian personality.</p>
        <p>From the Keirsey quiz I agree with a few of the characteristics of an Inspector which include persevering and
            following the rules. This is because I usually get very annoyed from not being able to complete or finish
            something and I will do as much as possible to get something done by a deadline. However, I only somewhat
            agree with patience, because over the years I think that I have gotten more patient, however I am still
            impatient for certain things that I am very excited for.</p>
        <p>I agree with many of the characteristics of an ISTJ, including that I am punctual and I am well aware of my
            areas of interest and/or responsibility (The reason it is called inspector). This is because I pride myself
            most of the time on being punctual when arriving to events/meetups and when going out, one of the things I
            plan the most is arriving on time no matter what. I agree with the awareness of my areas of interest andéor
            responsibility to a degree, because I am currently aware of general areas that I want to avoid/involve
            myself in, such as I would prefer to do something STEM related and hopefully avoid something related to
            caregiving or health.</p>
        <p>Another thing that ISTJ’s prefer, is when working ISTJ’s prefer having just facts given to them and are most
            productive when they have a step-by-step plan. I agree with this, because I prefer to have facts rather than
            opinions when working or speaking with others. Also, I tend to do better and work faster on projects that
            involve less creative thinking and more step-by-step planning, whether I am given a plan to do or I have to
            come up with a plan for myself.</p>
        <p>The final thing that the quiz has told me is that ISTJ’s are easily frustrated by others inconsistencies
            especially when others don’t keep their commitments, but usually keep their feelings to themselves. I agree
            with the first part somewhat, because when someone doesn’t do their part on a project or cancels last minute
            on plans I get somewhat irritated but not really, because I have gotten used to changing expectations closer
            to reality between different people. However, I especially agree with the final [art of usually keeping
            their feelings to themselves, because if I’m annoyed or angry with someone I always try my best not to show
            it with anyone.</p>
        <p>Some of the career choice areas for ISTJ include Management, Technical and Health Care. I agree with the
            first two, because before taking this test, I was already aware that I wanted to do something like
            accounting or computer science (which fall under management and technical). However, I disagree with Health
            Care, because my social skills are not good enough to help others, like you would need to in Health
            Care.</p>
        <p>Overall, I found the quizzes quite accurate when it came to characteristics and tendencies that my
            personality has. Along with being even more accurate if you average out the information from both quizzes to
            get rid of the things that may not be as accurate.</p>
