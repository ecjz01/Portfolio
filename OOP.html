        OOP or Object-Oriented Programming is one of the main concepts when learning to program in Java. The main idea
        of OOP is that “objects” that can have data as fields and code, are the main focus in your program. Each object
        will contain a set of attributes (variables) and behaviours (methods). OOP is meant to demonstrate the real
        world within the program, using “realistic” attributes and behaviours. However, it is important to distinguish
        that the difference between a class and an object, is that the class acts as a template/blueprint for the object
        and the object is an instance of that class. In an object oriented program, the access modifiers you use are
        crucial to making sure your program runs properly. The main three access modifiers are public, protected and
        private. By default, your variables and methods are declared as public when you do not
        specify the access modifier. When you use the public modifier, it means that any class may refer to that
        variable or call the method. A protected modifier means that only the current class and any subclasses of the
        class refer to that variable or call the method. A private modifier means that only the current class refer to
        that variable or call the method. Constructors are the templates of the object you have and what actually make
        the object and set the attributes. The constructors can have any amount of parameters as necessary and if there
        are no parameters, then that replaces the default constructor of the class (when a version of the object is made
        without any parameters). When it comes to the behaviours there are three main types of methods in an object’s
        class, getter, setter and mutator methods. Getter methods are methods that are used to get information about an
        attribute. Setter methods are methods that are used to set the attributes.

            As an example of OOP, you could have a car as a main class and then have a Van and Truck that extend the
            car.

        When Creating an Object Oriented Class it is important name the class as appropriate (what the object you are
        trying to make is). Then it is important to declare your instance variables with the right access modifier as
        they will be used throughout your program. After doing so you may choose to have a constructor to initialize
        those variables with proper values when creating those objects. When you are making your methods, it is
        important to have setters and getters for almost if not all of your instance variables and any other important
        data. For mutators it is important to make sure that the mutator is a behaviour that the object has.

        There are a few important terms to know when it comes to OOP. The first being encapsulation and abstraction.
        Encapsulation is generally referred to the ability for objects to contain all the methods and variables within
        them.
        . Abstraction on the other hand is the act of removing parts of your program, so that you can focus on another
        part.

        Another very important concept in OOP, is inheritance. The definition of inheritance is "a mechanism wherein a
        new class is derived from an existing class."<sup><a
            href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3226/inheritance-java">1</a> </sup>
        This can be simplified as a class aquiring the properties of a class above it. Which leads to hierarchy in
        programs. When creating object oriented programs, you will generally be faced with repeating code. To counteract
        this you should instead create one main object and extend that object in each of the more specific variations,
        where you can make the specific changes. The class that is inheriting another class is referred to as the
        subclass and the class that is being inherited is referred to as the superclass. A keyword you should remember
        is <b>extend</b>, because this keyword is what allows you to do this with your classes.
    </font></p>
    <code>
        <div class="boxed">
            class Super {
            <div class="tab">
                ...
                <br>
                ...
            </div>
            }
            <br>
            class Sub extends Super {
            <div class="tab">
                ...
                <br>
                ...
            </div>
            }
        </div>
    </code>
    <center>
        <p><font size="+1">
            The code above is an example of inheritance as the Sub class inherits the behaviours and attributes of the
            Super class.
        </font></p>
    </center>
    <p><font size="+2" style="margin-left: 100px">
        Once you have understood inheritance, a very important thing to know along with that is casting. Casting for
        objects and classes come in the form of upcasting and downcasting. Firstly, you must know that when you are
        casting, you're not changing the object, but instead you are labelling it differently. However, you can also
        cast primitive data types either using one of the methods (Integer.parseInt(), toString, etc) or simply by
        casting the data type to the variable. When upcasting objects it is done automatically for you, but when
        downcasting you must do it manually. This is because When you are upcasting it is guarenteed that a Cat is a
        Mammal, but when downcasting it isn't guarenteed that a mammal is a cat.
    </font></p>
    <code>
        <div class="boxed">
            Cat c = new Cat();
            <br>
            Mammal m = c
            <br>
            VS.
            <br>
            Cat c1 = new Car();
            <br>
            Animal a = c1;
            <br>
            Cat c2 = (Cat)a;
        </div>
    </code>
    <center>
        <p><font size="+1">
            As you can see the upcasting was done autimatically as you did not have to cast the Mammal object onto the
            Cat instance of c, while you had to cast the Cat object onto the Animal instance of a.

        The final topic I will cover in the first OOP section will be interfaces and abstract classes. Interfaces and
        abstract classes both act as a template for a class, because when creating an interface or abstract class you do
        not have to predefine your methods, but the methods must be implemented into and class that implements the
        interface or extends the abstract class. Although they seem similar they are different. While they both act as
        templates, you may only provide implementation in methods in an abstract class and not in interfaces, you can
        only have instance variables in abstract classes and you can only instantiate a subclass of an abstract class.
        You may be wondering now, how do I know when to use which? Well you would define a class as abstract when you
        want to extend that class and to create a basic template of the object. So that the subclasses can further
        define the object and you would define a class as interface when you want to create a template of a class, that
        will be implemented into another class.
